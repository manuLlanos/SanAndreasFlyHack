External hacks that looks up the game process, keeps the health at 200 and lets you fly around using the controls.  
The dll version is much faster and efficient, but you need to use an injector: https://github.com/manuLlanos/SanAndreasFlyHackDLL 
# Controls
b           - toggle on/off  
wasd        - move  
shift/lctrl - go up/down  
up/down     - increase/decrease flying speed  
F4          - stop process

## Notes

- In San Andreas, you cannot fly while inside a vehicle
- In Vice City, you can use it while in vehicles but the directions are messed up, you can mostly just go up or down
