External hacks that looks up the game process, keeps the health at 200 and lets you fly around using the controls.
# Controls
b           - toggle on/ff  
wasd        - move  
shift/lctrl - go up/down  
up/down     - increase/decrease flying speed  
F4          - stop process

## Notes

- In San Andreas, you will probably get staggered often upon hitting the ground at high downward speeds. And you cannot fly while CJ is swimming or inside a car.
- In Vice City, you can fly out of the water at any time. Inside vehicles, you can fly but the controls are weird depending on what direction the vehicle is looking at.
